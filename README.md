- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tonyg92x :               My full name is Anthony Guay.
- 👀 I’m interested in :               Programing, game developpement, american football, 
                                        cooking, workout, football coaching and gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning :          C++ / Python for game developpement.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on :   Any game projects to get some experience for the next year.
                                        I prefer to maximise the use of a language instead of
                                        using a game engine like Unreal or Unity. I really need to
                                        practice my programing skills. The usage of such game
                                        engine is pretty easy and straight foward. I want to focus
                                        on harder topics.
