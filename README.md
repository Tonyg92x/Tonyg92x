<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About me
My name is Anthony Guay. I am 25 years old and I am studying at 42 Quebec. I am interested in game programming / security / malware analysis. I went to University Sherbrooke to study buisness while playing american football and I went to Laval University in computer science. I apply the same work ethic I did on the football field to learn and become a great programmer.
